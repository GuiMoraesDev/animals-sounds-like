## Requirements

## UI/UX

- The UI should look like the mockup in /mocks.
- Clicking the "Make Noise" button should cause the noise to be displayed briefly and fade away.

### Delete Button

- Add a "Delete" button to the right of the "Make Noise" button
- The delete button should only show when you hover on an animal
- The delete button should remove the animal from the list

### Add Button

- Add an "Add" button below the last animal
- The add button should create a random animal
 
### React.Context

- Move the animals into a React.Context, instead of passing as as prop to AnimalsView

### Points of improvement üõë

- The animation at animal name that's currently wrongly toggling the visibility, but this behavior can be easily fixed by creating a custom animation at the tailwind.config.js file
- The random animal creation feature would be better using a  pool of animals and their sounds to create the whole animal object randomly.
- There's a warning at the console about the title tag it's placed on the _document file, the solution it's on this [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-document-title)
